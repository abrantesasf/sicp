# SICP Solutions and Study Guide

This is a set of solutions and a study guide for the book ["Structure And Interpretation Of Computer Programs"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start)
(SICP), using [the Racket language](https://racket-lang.org/).

To start a REPL with the solution to a particular exercise preloaded
do this:

```
racket -f ch1/1-17-multiply-double.scm -i
```

No output will be produced, you will need to type in some Racket code
in the REPL to check that the program works as required by the given
exercise.

Read the [study guide](STUDY.md) or [more detailed notes on the solutions](NOTES.md).
