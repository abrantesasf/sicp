Those are my solutions to the exercises from the book "Structure And
Interpretation Of Computer Programs" ("SICP" as most people call it).
At this point of my time they are simply the result of me studying the
book and are not specifically meant for public usage - thus the
explanations, if they are any, may be not very well written.

I mostly use MIT Scheme to run the exercises. The exception was the
exercises related to the "picture language", where I managed to get
the graphics library run with PLT Scheme, but had no success with MIT
Scheme. On the other hand, PLT Scheme doesn't support set-car! and
set-cdr! by default anymore, so for most other exercises it is better
to stick with MIT Scheme.

There are cases in the book where the authors ask you to code a
solution using some code which will only be presented later in the
book. For those exercises, you may want to download the code from the
book (http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/code/index.html) and use it if you
want to actually run those solutions. After the authors present the
code for the dependencies, I tend to provide complete working programs
- which has the cons of having a very large solution file even if the
change that was done is very little.
