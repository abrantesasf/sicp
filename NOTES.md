## Notes on the solutions to the exercises

* There are cases in the book where the authors ask you to code a
  solution making use of some code which will only be presented later
  in the book. I tend to provide complete working programs for each
  exercise, which makes it easy to run and test the solution, but has
  the downside of resulting in lengthy solution files even when the
  change done in a particular given exercise was very small.
